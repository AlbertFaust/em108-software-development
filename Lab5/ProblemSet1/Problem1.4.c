/*Laboratory Session 5 - Problem Set No. 1 - Problem 1.4
Write a program which reads three values a, b and c that are the coefficients of a quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c = 0. 
Calculate the roots of the equation after you verify that (b^2-4ac) is positive. 
What is the other condition you have to test for such as you can calculate the roots? 
The roots are given by r = (-b Â± sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a. 
Print either the roots or a message of error if you cannot calculate the roots. Test the program.
Note: you need to add the precompiler directive #include <math.h> at the start of your program to use the function sqrt().*/
